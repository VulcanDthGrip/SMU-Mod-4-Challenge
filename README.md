## SMU-Mod-4-Challenge - Javascript Quiz    

The purpose of this challenge was to develop and deploy a quiz that contained the following:
1.  Several questions and a list of answers to choose from
2.  Points are given when the correct answer is chosen by the user
3.  A timer that countdowns when the user begins the quiz and increments when the incorrect answer is chosen by the user
4.  The total points earned for correct answers are displayed at the end of the quiz
5.  If there was a high score, the user can type in their initial into the submission field and will be saved when the user clicks on the save button
6. The user can choose to go back to the main page and click on High Scores to view a list of the tops scores the their initials
7. The user can click on the play again button to begin the quiz again

The build behind this game is compartmentalized into several categories:
1. Index
2. Game
3. HighScores
4. End 

And each category contains and HTML, CSS, and JS file. Each category is linked to each other via the <script> element.
